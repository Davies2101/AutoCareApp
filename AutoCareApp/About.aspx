                        <p align="justify">AutoCare are a Mobile Car Valeting company who struggle with the management of bookings and cancellations with customers. Recently, the business has become increasingly popular and the need for an electronic system or web-based application would be vitally important for managing its customers and bookings. AutoCare are similar to most ‘small companies’ in the aspect that they also use social media platforms as their means of communication and advertisement. With the increase in demand of mobile car valeting, management is struggling to monitor bookings and cancelations made by customers of AutoCare. This indicating that the current business model is no longer viable - this new system will address these issues.</p align="justify">

                        <p align="justify">The need for a storage system where booking details and vehicle information can be kept in a centralised and easily accessible location is a must. The increase in custom at AutoCare means that the turnover in cars must be sped up, ensuring however that the standard of service is still kept to a high. AutoCare often find themselves referring to their appointments schedule (paper-based system) to see when the next customer is due in, sometimes there are crossovers in bookings and in worst case scenarios key information is left out such as the service type or car registration. This can result in poor customer service and waste the time of both staff and customers of AutoCare</p align="justify">
